									<p>Welcome to USA, welcome to Buffalo, and welcome to UB!!! This is a reference article for Indian graduate students in UB, providing some ideas about shopping. There are two sections here: (i) preparatory shopping in India (before coming to US) and (ii) shopping in the US.  It should be noted that you could bring more or less items from India depending on the amount of luggage you can check-in/carry in your flight (most flights allow 2 check-in bags of 23 kg each, one carry-on bag of 7 kg, and one ‘personal item’ which could be a laptop bag or duffel bag – please refer to your flight details for more detailed information on this). Hence, accordingly you could plan your shopping in India. </p>
									<b>Preparatory Shopping in India</b>
									<ol>
										<li>Laptop, phone, tablet, power bank, flash drives, universal power plug converter, headphones/earphones, calculator – if you already have some (or all of these), bring those to US if you do not mind in continuing to use those. You will be able to save a lot of money in buying everything afresh in US. Of course, many electronic items might cost you less in US, but you might have to wait until Thanksgiving (last week of November) to get the best deals. So, unless you really want to buy new electronic gadgets and are ready to spend quite a bit, please bring your old stuff. Remember that most electronic items in India (other than laptops and phones that have in-built adapters) work only on 220 V electricity whereas those in the U.S. work on 110 V. Also, make sure that you have a universal power adapter to match your devices’ chargers to the power sockets in the U.S.</li>
										<li>Food - Please read the GISA article on the list of food items that you could bring from India to make your life easy, especially in your first few days or weeks in Buffalo. </li>
										<li>Kitchen items – you may bring a pressure cooker if you would like, and other light-weight utensils that are not available in US. Most utensils, however, are available in US. You can check on <a href="https://www.walmart.com/store/2586/whats-new">Walmart website </a> for utensils that are available here. Blenders/mixers that work on 220V in India will not work in the 110 V setting here without an adapter. </li>
										<li> Clothing and shoes – clothing costs less in India, except winter gear. The latest fashion is available in India, so it might be better to shop your favorite style of clothes (one or two sets of formal wear which might come handy in job interviews/conferences/presentations/other formal occasions, and as many sets of casual wear and night wear as you want) in India. If you are from a place where the winters are cold, there is a good chance that your local shops have good winter clothing, so get some good jackets/sweaters/woolen caps/gloves etc. However, make sure those clothes are good for very cold and snowy winters. If you are from a warmer place, probably your local shops might not have good winter clothing in stock – in that case it is better to buy from US. You may get some bedsheets and pillow covers from India, however it is better to buy a heavy blanket from the US. Similar suggestions hold for shoes also. Bathroom slippers and casual shoes are available for cheap in Walmart, however you need good quality winter shoes to resist the -20 degree Celsius winters. Frostbite might be quite unlikely, however you might not want to risk the possibility of your feet and hand going numb.</li>
										<li>Notebooks, pen, other office stationary – you may bring notebooks if you have specific preferences, however it would be better to avoid them and pack some Indian food that you like. Notebooks might be a tad more expensive in the US, however that’s fine because you might not be using a lot of those. You will always get enough ‘one-side-empty’ sheets for rough work from the printing stations in UB libraries. </li>
									</ol>
									<p><b>Shopping in the US:</b> Please remember that for anything that you might want to order from Amazon online, as a student, you are eligible to try Amazon Prime for free for 6 months using your buffalo.edu email address. You and your friends may decide to take turns in trying out Amazon Prime for 6 months each. Make sure you cancel your Prime trial well in advance before the 6 months so that Amazon does not charge (~99$) your bank account/credit card for the next 6 months/one year of service. It could happen Amazon would charge 99$ on your bank account, and if your account does not have sufficient balance, the bank would charge you an overdraft fee (~40$ in some banks).</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Mobile phone and phone connection – if you already have a phone, you may continue using it, although due to . There are many telephone service providers (AT&T, T-Mobile, Google’s Project Fi, Lycamobile, Verizon, Sprint, Ultramobile, Cricket, etc.). Each provider has its own pros and cons, so it is your own decision to choose the plan that you like. AT&T service is known to be good, many students use T-Mobile’s ‘family plans,’ and Lycamobile and Ultramobile and are known to have cheap international call plans. You could find many good deals online (Amazon, or individual brands) or in store (Best Buy) for laptops and other electronics.</li>
										<li>Food – Bread, peanut butter, Nutella, jam/jelly, eggs, rice, curd, pickles – these might be the staple food of many students. There are two good reasons to always have these in stock: (i) these are not expensive, (ii) even when you are ready to spend more money to buy ‘fancier’ food, toasting a bread and spreading peanut butter/Nutella/jam/jelly over it, or preparing an egg-omlette, or making curd rice out of already cooked rice with a side of pickle takes very little preparation time. This would be a life-saver especially in hard times (such as exams, homework, projects). All these are available for cheap in Aldi, and Walmart. Aldi is walking distance from UB South campus (near which most Indian graduate students live). Walmart is also not far, but probably a little too much to walk. However, there is an Indian store (Super Bazaar) close to Walmart which offers free pick-up and drop to students who wants to shop with them. That is, Super Bazaar people will pick you up from your home (near South or North Campus), take you to Super Bazaar where you would shop, keep your items with them, walk to Walmart which is across the road, do your shopping, bring your items to Super Bazaar, and they will drop you back home! This is a great convenience that UB students enjoy! There are also other Indian stores (such as Spice Bazaar, which is also very close to Walmart) which offer competitive prices). One final word about water – many students use regular tap water, however you may buy a water purifier (~15-35$) if you wish. Except the India-specific food (and some other items) which you would get only in Indian stores, you would get most of the other stuff in Walmart and Aldi. The prices at Aldi are known to be a little less than that at Walmart, however not for the same brands. Aldi’s proximity is very convenient, especially to those who live in Winspear/West Winspear/Tyler/Merrimac/Heath/Englewood/Montrose streets. There are also a Tops supermarket, an Indian restaurant ‘Dosa Place,’ and many other eateries including Subway and McDonalds near UB South Campus. There are many options inside UB North Campus, however some of those might be closed on weekends etc.</li>
										<li>Personal items – to complement what you have bought from India, you will get almost everything that you need from Walmart (includes all toilet necessities, clothing such as blanket/’comforter’, kitchen utensils). You will get bread toaster and electric rice cooker that you may decide to share with your friends who occupy the same house etc. Dollar Tree is an even better option, where you get many things including stationery/office supplies, chocolates, bathroom necessities, kitchenware, decoration and party material such as candles, color papers, hats (for example if you want to host a party in your house for a friend’s birthday!), and so on. The best thing about Dollar Tree is that EVERYTHING COSTS ONLY A DOLLAR (OR LESS)! There is a Dollar Tree is the University Plaza, adjacent to Tops Supermarket near UB South Campus. There are some other options that are often overlooked – for example, the “Fallas” shop in the University Plaza. Fallas is a clearance store, and you will get clothing (almost everything that you want – including formal suites) for much lower prices than you would get anywhere else. However, you might have to compromise the quality a little bit. Personally, I have found Fallas to be very useful. JCPenney is also a good option to look for clothing, they offer very good deals frequently. If you are looking to buy some furniture to make your unfurnished home more cozy, Walmart is definitely an option. However, do visit thrift stores such as “GoodWill” stores, which run on donated, used stuff. They have furniture (dining tables, chairs, couches) for amazing deals! The only problem is that because they rely on donations, you cannot ensure that they have supplies throughout the year. However, keep visiting such stores and one day you will find your luck, probably in the form of a cozy three-seater couch for 15$!!!</li>
										<li>Holiday shopping – the best time to shop is during the Thanksgiving week. Thanksgiving is on the last Thursday of November, and starting that day, almost every shop offers huge discounts online and in store. For electronics, you may find deals in stores such as Best Buy, Walmart, Target, etc. and online on Amazon, and many other brands). For clothing, there is everyone’s favorite – Shopping outlet of the Niagara Falls USA (famously known as the Outlet Mall), where you get deals on all clothing and apparel brands! In Walmart you would find great deals on almost everything that you would want. The greatest deals are called `doorbusters,’ for which you have to wait for a couple of hours or more in front of the store (in the cold outside!), however if you make it, you will be paid off with awesome deals which would fetch you profits of more than 200$ or 300$. So make sure you reserve your big shopping plans for Thanksgiving week (Thanksgiving Thursday, Black Friday, that Saturday or Sunday, or Cyber Monday). There will be very good deals on clothing in JCPenney as well. </li>

									<p>
										The points mentioned above are only a few suggestions. We would keep adding more information, so at any time, please consult with your friends/fellow GISA members who are already in UB, before finalizing your shopping plans! Enjoy your shopping in Buffalo!
